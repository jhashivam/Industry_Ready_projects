# Docker

### What is Docker?
Docker is an open source project for building, shipping, and running programs. It is a command- line program, a background process, and a set of remote services that take a logistical approach to solving common software problems and simplifying your experience installing, running, publishing, and removing software. It accomplishes this by using an operating system technology called containers.
