* Reset staging area to match most recent commit,but leave the working directory unchanged.
* Reset staging area and working directory to match most recent commit and overwrites all changes in the working directory.
* Reset the staging area to match, but leave the working directory alone.
* Same as previous, but resets both the staging area & working directory to match. Deletes uncommitted changes, and all commits after <commit>.
